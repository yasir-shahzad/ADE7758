OPERATIONAL MODE REGISTER (0x13)
The general configuration of the ADE7758 is defined by writing to the OPMODE register. 
Table 18 summarizes the functionality of each bit in the OPMODE register.

Bit Location		Bit Mnemonic		Default Value		Description
0					DISHPF				0					The HPFs in all current channel inputs are disabled when this bit is set.
1					DISLPF				0					The LPFs after the watt and VAR multipliers are disabled when this bit is set.
2					DISCF				1					The frequency outputs APCF and VARCF are disabled when this bit is set.
3 to 5				DISMOD				0					By setting these bits, ADE7758’s ADCs can be turned off. In normal operation, these bits should be left at Logic 0.
															DISMOD[2:0]				Description
															0	0	0				Normal operation.
															1	0	0				Redirect the voltage inputs to the signal paths for the current channels and the current inputs to the signal paths for the voltage channels.
															0	0	1				Switch off only the current channel ADCs.
															1	0	1				Switch off current channel ADCs and redirect the current input signals to the voltage channel signal paths.
															0	1	0				Switch off only the voltage channel ADCs.
															1	1	0				Switch off voltage channel ADCs and redirect the voltage input signals to the current channel signal paths.

/**
MEASUREMENT MODE REGISTER (0x14)
The configuration of the PERIOD and peak measurements made by the ADE7758 is defined by writing to the MMODE register. 
Table 19 summarizes the functionality of each bit in the MMODE register.

Bit Location		Bit Mnemonic		Default Value		Description
0 to 1				FREQSEL				0					These bits are used to select the source of the measurement of the voltage line frequency.
															FREQSEL1		FREQSEL0		Source
															0				0				Phase A
															0				1				Phase B
															1				0				Phase C
															1				1				Reserved
2 to 4				PEAKSEL				7					These bits select the phases used for the voltage and current peak registers.
															Setting Bit 2 switches the IPEAK and VPEAK registers to hold the absolute values 
															of the largest current and voltage waveform (over a fixed number of half-line cycles) 
															from Phase A. The number of half-line cycles is determined by the content of the 
															LINECYC register. At the end of the LINECYC number of half-line cycles, the content 
															of the registers is replaced with the new peak values. Similarly, setting Bit 3 turns 
															on the peak detection for Phase B, and Bit 4 for Phase C. Note that if more than one 
															bit is set, the VPEAK and IPEAK registers can hold values from two different phases, that is,
															the voltage and current peak are independently processed (see the Peak Current Detection section).
5 to 7				PKIRQSEL			7					These bits select the phases used for the peak interrupt detection. 
															Setting Bit 5 switches on the monitoring of the absolute current and voltage waveform to Phase A.
															Similarly, setting Bit 6 turns on the waveform detection for Phase B, and Bit 7 for Phase C.
															Note that more than one bit can be set for detection on multiple phases. 
															If the absolute values of the voltage or current waveform samples in the selected phases exceeds 
															the preset level specified in the VPINTLVL or IPINTLVL registers the corresponding bit(s) in the 
															STATUS registers are set (see the Peak Current Detection section).

/** 
COMPUTATIONAL MODE REGISTER (0x16)
The computational method of the ADE7758 is defined by writing to the COMPMODE register.

0 to 1			CONSEL			0					These bits are used to select the input to the energy accumulation registers. 
													CONSEL[1:0] = 11 is reserved. IA, IB, and IC are IA, IB, and IC phase shifted by –90°, respectively.
													Registers		CONSEL[1, 0] = 00		CONSEL[1, 0] = 01			CONSEL[1, 0] = 10
													AWATTHR			VA × IA					VA × (IA – IB)				VA × (IA–IB)
													BWATTHR			VB × IB					0							0
													CWATTHR			VC × IC					VC × (IC – IB)				VC × IC

													AVARHR			VA × IA					VA × (IA – IB)				VA × (IA–IB)

													CVAHR			VCRMS × ICRMS			VCRMS × ICRMS				VCRMS × ICRMS

2 to 4			TERMSEL			7					These bits are used to select the phases to be included in the APCF and VARCF pulse outputs. 
													Setting Bit 2 selects Phase A (the inputs to AWATTHR and AVARHR registers) to be included. 
													Bit 3 and Bit 4 are for Phase B and Phase C, respectively. 
													Setting all three bits enables the sum of all three phases to be included in the frequency outputs 
													(see the Active Power Frequency Output and the Reactive Power Frequency Output sections).

5				ABS				0					Setting this bit places the APCF output pin in absolute only mode. 
													Namely, the APCF output frequency is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the watt-hour 
													accumulation registers (AWATTHR, BWATTHR, and CWATTHR). 
													Note that this bit only affects the APCF pin and has no effect on the content of the corresponding 
													registers.
													
6				SAVAR			0					Setting this bit places the VARCF output pin in the signed adjusted mode. 
													Namely, the VARCF output frequency is proportional to the sign-adjusted sum of the VAR-hour accumulation 
													registers (AVARHR, BVARHR, and CVARHR). 
													The sign of the VAR is determined from the sign of the watt calculation from the corresponding phase, 
													that is, the sign of the VAR is flipped if the sign of the watt is negative, and if the watt is positive, 
													there is no change to the sign of the VAR. 
													Note that this bit only affects the VARCF pin and has no effect on the content of the corresponding 
													registers.
													
7				NOLOAD			0					Setting this bit activates the no-load threshold in the ADE7758.

/** 
LINE CYCLE ACCUMULATION MODE REGISTER (0x17)

0				LWATT			0					Setting this bit places the watt-hour accumulation registers 
													(AWATTHR, BWATTHR, and CWATTHR registers) into line-cycle accumulation mode.
1				LVAR			0					Setting this bit places the VAR-hour accumulation registers (AVARHR, BVARHR, and CVARHR registers) 
													into line-cycle accumulation mode.
2				LVA				0					Setting this bit places the VA-hour accumulation registers (AVAHR, BVAHR, and CVAHR registers) 
													into line-cycle accumulation mode.
3 to 5			ZXSEL			7					These bits select the phases used for counting the number of zero crossings in the line-cycle 
													accumulation mode. Bit 3, Bit 4, and Bit 5 select Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C, respectively. 
													More than one phase can be selected for the zero-crossing detection, 
													and the accumulation time is shortened accordingly.
6				RSTREAD			1					Setting this bit enables the read-with-reset for all the WATTHR, VARHR, and VAHR registers for all three
													phases, that is, a read to those registers resets the registers to 0 after the content of the registers
													have been read. This bit should be set to Logic 0 when the LWATT, LVAR, or LVA bits are set to Logic 1.
7				FREQSEL			0					Setting this bit causes the FREQ (0x10) register to display the period, instead of the frequency of the 
													line input.

/** INTERRUPT STATUS REGISTER (0x19)/RESET INTERRUPT STATUS REGISTER (0x1A)
The interrupt status register is used to determine the source of an interrupt event. 
When an interrupt event occurs in the ADE7758, the corresponding flag in the interrupt status register is set. 
The IRQ pin goes active low if the corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set. 
When the MCU services the interrupt, it must first carry out a read from the interrupt status register to determine the source of the interrupt. 
All the interrupts in the interrupt status register stay at their logic high state after an event occurs. 
The state of the interrupt bit in the interrupt status register is reset to its default value once the reset interrupt status register is read.
